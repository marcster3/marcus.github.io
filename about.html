            <p class="abt-text">With the rise of AI representation in the data space is becoming paramount.
                Something very important to me is responsibly training data on datasets that represent everyone.
                Having diversity in AI management is the only way for AI to treat the people it is trying to help fairly.
                In the future I could see myself as part of a team helping to manage AI and train it on socially consious data.

            <h2 class="abt-subtitle">Film</h2>
            <p class="abt-text">Since I was a child I have always loved watching movies. Coming into adulthood, that love has only grown. 
                Through my time at Cornell I am now minoring in film and expanding my interest into film theory and how film can be valuable beyond entertainment.
                I have found its connections to literature, art, science, psychology, and philosophy as avenues to explore film in an intelectual way.
                I have made one film, Breakfast for Two linked on the <a href="projects.html" class="abt-link">Projects</a> tab and have been a part of many other films from other students.
                Now understanding the aspects of the filmmaking process and its potential as an academic and educational tool my appreciation for film will only grow.

            <h2 class="abt-subtitle">Design</h2>
            <p class="abt-text">I began college as an architecture major which developed my skills and abilities as a designer.
                Before that I used to paint and draw frequently. Both of these together have piqued my interest in art and design.
                Through college I have used many design mediums learning how to do woodwork, metalwork, and digital 2D and 3D design.
                My time working at Post Company, an interior design and architcture firm in Brooklyn further solidified these skills.
