        <h2 class="film-subtitle">Synopsis</h2>
        <p class="film-desc">Charlie is feeling depressed and is thinking about death. Charlie and Sam have been in the same
            situation before and Sam knows exactly what to say to Charlie to get her out of her rut. Sam
            makes jokes to Charlie and talks about what tomorrow morning would look like without her.
            Charlie is unable to resist the temptation to laugh and smile. Sam talks about his own struggle
            with mental health to make Charlie feel more normal. Charlie begins to be able to feel better
            about herself, feeling happier and knowing someone truly cares about her.
        </p>
        <h2 class="film-subtitle">Director's Statement</h2>
        <p class="film-desc">A friend contemplating suicide is ont of the most terrifying realities to face in friendship. Being
            careful about what you say and how you say it is paramount in those moments. It takes empathy,
            love, and understanding while also trying to make that person feel normal and remind them how
            much you care about them. I am very inspired by Ingmar Bergmanâ€™s films where conversations
            on topics of this severity are dealt with in the most plain and direct way while also feeling
            extremely human. His focus on people as being loved and loving while being flawed is
            something I wanted to explore. They both have admiration and care for each other that is clearly
            beyond what most normal friendships would be. Through this understanding Sam is able to help
            Charlie and show how much he cares about him.
